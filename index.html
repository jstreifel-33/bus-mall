      <p id="greeting">Welcome valued customer to the BusMall Focus Group survey. You've been selected among our many customers to participate in this survey because of your dedicated love for all things unique and novel. At BusMall, we pride ourselves on our ability to offer products that people want to use. With that goal in mind we ask for your help. This survey will present you with 3 potential products that we think might be a good fit for BusMall customers. Please select 1 product from the 3 displayed that you would be most likely to purchase. You will be presented with 25 groups of products total, and your voting results will be viewable at the end. Have fun, and thank you for helping make BusMall better than ever before!
