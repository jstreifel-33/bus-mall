## Reflections and Comments

This was a pretty fun project overall. I learned a lot about how to manage and track objects within JavaScript. This was also a good introduction to local storage, and how to handle the storage and retrieval of data. this also acted a small introduction to CSS transitions for me, which was fun to get into and play with. There is currently no way to clear local storage from the web page itself, so clearing must be accomplished through browser Dev Tools.
